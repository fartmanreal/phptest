              But one day, a group of humans stumbled upon my hiding place. They were startled to find a real-life troll, and they immediately reported me. I tried to explain that I meant no harm, but they refused to listen.</p>

            <p class="hole-text">With no other options, I was forced to flee my "troll hole" and take up residence under a nearby bridge. It was not an ideal situation, but at least I had some shelter.
              It wasn't the life I had imagined for myself, but it was the only life I had in this world. And so I continued to live under the bridge, hoping that someday humans would learn to accept trolls like me.
