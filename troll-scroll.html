        I am Grug, a time-traveling troll who found himself stranded in the present. As I looked around, I saw humans everywhere, and I soon discovered that they hated trolls. I felt afraid and unsure of what to do, but I knew that I needed to find a way to survive in this new world.

          <p class="text">I decided to understand why humans hated trolls. I asked around and discovered that they believed trolls to be dangerous and destructive creatures. I knew that I was not like that, and I tried to show humans that there was another side to trolls.

            However, no matter what I did, humans always reacted with fear and hostility. It became clear to me that I could never truly integrate into human society, and so I decided to go into hiding.
            
            I retreated to my "troll hole" and lived there in solitude, keeping away from human settlements. It was a lonely life, but at least I was safe</p>
